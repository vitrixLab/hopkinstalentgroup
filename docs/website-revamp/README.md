# HTG Website Revamp Plan

> **Project:** Hopkins Talent Group (HTG) website revamp  
> **Status:** Proposed execution plan — approval and verification dependencies remain open  
> **Governing tracker:** [Issue #10](https://github.com/vitrixLab/hopkinstalentgroup/issues/10)  
> **Strategy source:** [HTG Brand Research](../research/branding/README.md)  
> **Visual method:** [Visual Engineering Design Standard](../research/visual-engineering/VISUAL_DESIGN_STANDARD.md)

## 1. Purpose and authority

This document owns the website-specific execution plan: information architecture, page responsibilities, visitor journeys, content requirements, implementation workstreams, and website acceptance. The [HTG Website Revamp RAG Context](../research/HTG_WEBSITE_REVAMP_RAG_CONTEXT.md) is a derived retrieval aid only; it does not replace this plan or Issue #10.

It does not redefine HTG's business strategy, positioning, capability taxonomy, audience hierarchy, or relationship classifications. Those are maintained in [HTG Brand Research](../research/branding/README.md). If a conflict appears, pause affected work and record the decision in Issue #10; do not silently create a second definition.

This is a plan, not evidence that designs, content, approvals, implementation, legal review, or release are complete.

## 2. Website objectives

The website should:
1. Explain HTG's role in clear, factual language.
2. Help visitors identify a relevant pathway.
3. Distinguish HTG-delivered services from operating businesses, partners, clients, referrals, and unverified relationships.
4. Route each inquiry to a confirmed destination and accountable owner.
5. Work accessibly and reliably across supported screen sizes.

The experience model is Hub & Spoke as defined in the brand strategy. The website must not imply that HTG owns or directly delivers every service or organization displayed.

## 3. Visitor tasks and journeys

Design journeys only after confirming audience priorities and capability definitions in the brand strategy.

| Visitor task | Website responsibility | Required evidence before publication |
|---|---|---|
| Understand HTG | Explain the organization and coordinating role | Approved business description and positioning |
| Explore a capability | Present relevant service information and limitations | Verified service, delivery entity, geography, availability |
| Identify a route | Offer clear audience-appropriate navigation | Approved audience mapping and CTA |
| Evaluate a network participant | Explain the actual relationship | Verified classification and permission |
| Make an inquiry | Collect necessary information and route it correctly | Confirmed form purpose, recipient, notices, owner, handling |

Do not invent response times, lead ownership, eligibility, service guarantees, commission terms, or investor access.

## 4. Proposed information architecture

This sitemap is a working proposal. Validate it against approved services, audience priorities, content availability, and operational ownership.

| Page / route | Purpose | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| Home | Explain HTG and route visitors | Approved positioning, verified capability entry points, pathways, approved proof, primary CTA |
| About HTG | Explain the organization and operating model | Approved business description, role of the hub, verified background |
| Capabilities | Help visitors compare pathways | Approved capability summaries and links to confirmed services |
| Capability detail | Explain a specific service | Audience, scope, provider/delivery status, geography, process, limitations, CTA |
| Network / Partners | Explain verified ecosystem relationships | Approved descriptions, relationship labels, permissions, disclosures |
| Artists & Events | Route relevant talent and event inquiries | Verified offerings, responsibilities, eligibility, inquiry process |
| Referral Partners | Explain approved collaboration pathways | Qualification, process, written terms where applicable |
| Contact / Inquiry | Route requests responsibly | Inquiry categories, required fields, privacy notices, confirmation and error states |

Do not create a route merely to fill the sitemap. If a service or relationship is unverified, omit the public claim until resolved.

## 5. Homepage content architecture

This is a structural sequence, not approved copy or final visual design.

1. **Header:** approved HTG identity, concise navigation, primary CTA only when destination and owner are confirmed.
2. **Hero:** clear statement of what HTG is and whom it connects; avoid unsupported superlatives and vague promises.
3. **Capability entry points:** use capability definitions and service availability approved in the brand strategy.
4. **How the network works:** explain movement from visitor need to provider, operating business, or introduction; identify responsibility accurately.
5. **Audience routes:** present only approved pathways with useful next steps.
6. **Verified proof:** permissioned testimonials, case studies, credentials, metrics, or third-party marks only when substantiated.
7. **Closing CTA:** one clear action tied to a functioning route and accountable owner.
8. **Footer:** accurate business/contact information and applicable privacy, terms, registration, licensing, and service disclosures.

All headlines, descriptions, and CTA language remain proposed until approved.

## 6. Content model and publication controls

For each page section or service record, maintain:
- Stable content identifier and page/route.
- Approved title and description.
- Intended audience and visitor task.
- Capability/service reference from the brand strategy.
- Delivery entity and relationship classification.
- Geographic scope, eligibility, and current availability.
- Evidence/source and last-verified date.
- Permission status for names, logos, images, testimonials, and case-study material.
- Required qualifier/disclosure.
- CTA destination and operational owner.
- Content approver and approval date.

The relationship taxonomy and rules are owned by [HTG Brand Research §2.3](../research/branding/README.md). This plan consumes those classifications; it must not introduce a competing taxonomy.

**Publication rule:** no unverified claim, logo, endorsement, testimonial, credential, metric, service promise, or relationship is published. Unknown items remain omitted or clearly marked as internal placeholders.

## 7. Design handoff dependency

The six-sheet design handoff, approval sequence, and export/source-file requirements are governed by [Issue #10](https://github.com/vitrixLab/hopkinstalentgroup/issues/10) and the brand strategy. This plan does not reproduce sheet specifications.

Website-specific design inputs:
- Approved sitemap and page purpose.
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile behavior.
- Content-length and missing-content states.
- Navigation, form, CTA, focus, and error states.
- Legal/disclosure layout slots.
- Verified content and permissioned assets.

Use the [Visual Engineering Design Standard](../research/visual-engineering/VISUAL_DESIGN_STANDARD.md) for geometry, grid, typography, color application, composition, and visual QA.

## 8. Implementation workstreams

### A — Existing-site and technical discovery
- Inventory current routes, pages, components, assets, forms, and integrations.
- Record existing behavior before changing it.
- Verify framework, deployment platform, domain/DNS, hosting constraints, and environment configuration from repository and operator evidence.
- Identify technical risks and dependencies.

**Exit evidence:** route inventory, component/asset inventory, deployment facts with sources, baseline screenshots, issue list.

### B — UX and content architecture
- Validate sitemap and navigation against approved strategy.
- Define page templates and reusable content structures.
- Map each route to a visitor task and approved CTA.
- Confirm form purpose, data minimization, notices, recipient, and inquiry owner.
- Reserve applicable legal/disclosure content slots.

**Exit evidence:** approved sitemap, page outlines, journey map, content model, CTA/recipient register.

### C — Visual design
- Apply approved identity direction and design-system tokens.
- Produce page-level layouts and responsive states.
- Validate real content, including long, missing, and empty states.
- Record review feedback and measurable revisions.

**Exit evidence:** approved design artifacts, source files, tokens/assets, responsive comparisons, decision record.

### D — Frontend implementation
- Implement approved routes and responsive layouts.
- Reuse components where behavior and semantics are genuinely shared.
- Integrate only verified content and approved data sources.
- Implement forms and CTAs only against confirmed endpoints.
- Preserve semantic structure, keyboard operation, visible focus, and reduced-motion preferences.
- Do not add analytics or third-party integrations without an approved purpose, privacy/consent treatment, and configuration.

**Exit evidence:** implemented routes, component/state inventory, functional tests, responsive screenshots, integration record.

### E — Content integration and QA
- Load approved copy and permissioned assets.
- Check service descriptions, relationship labels, disclosures, and destinations.
- Test form validation, success, error, and abuse-protection behavior.
- Test supported browsers and viewport sizes.
- Run accessibility, performance, metadata, link, and regression checks.

**Exit evidence:** content sign-off, QA report, accessibility findings, performance results, defect log, release candidate.

### F — Release and post-launch
- Confirm deployment target, domain/DNS, environment variables, backups, and rollback procedure.
- Obtain required business, content, technical, and legal approvals.
- Deploy only after blocking acceptance criteria pass.
- Run production smoke tests and verify inquiry routing.
- Monitor agreed operational indicators and record post-launch defects.

**Exit evidence:** release approval, deployment record, rollback plan, smoke-test report, post-launch review.

## 9. Website acceptance criteria

A page is not accepted because a screenshot looks complete. Each applicable criterion needs a test result and evidence.

### Content and accuracy
- [ ] Page purpose and audience are clear.
- [ ] All public claims trace to approved content.
- [ ] Service availability, provider, scope, and geography are verified.
- [ ] Relationship labels and third-party permissions are correct.
- [ ] No unsupported testimonials, metrics, credentials, guarantees, or endorsements.
- [ ] CTAs have confirmed destinations and operational owners.
- [ ] Applicable legal/disclosure content has been reviewed by the responsible qualified party.

### UX and responsive behavior
- [ ] Navigation and core tasks work on supported desktop, tablet, and mobile sizes.
- [ ] No critical content is clipped or horizontally overflows.
- [ ] Long, missing, empty, and error states are handled.
- [ ] Forms explain purpose, required fields, notices, errors, and next steps.
- [ ] Keyboard users can reach and operate all interactive controls.

### Accessibility and technical quality
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA is the target for applicable content and interactions.
- [ ] Text and UI contrast are tested; grayscale review is supplemental only.
- [ ] Semantic structure, accessible names, focus visibility, and keyboard behavior are verified.
- [ ] Images have meaningful alternative text or are decorative.
- [ ] Reduced-motion preferences are respected.
- [ ] Performance, metadata, links, and cross-browser behavior are tested.
- [ ] No secrets, private data, or unapproved tracking are exposed.

### Evidence record
For every gate, retain the requirement, test method/environment, expected and actual result, evidence link, reviewer/date, and defect reference/resolution. Do not mark a gate passed without evidence.

## 10. Website-specific dependencies

Business strategy, audience priority, relationship classification, brand approval, and the master approval blocker are maintained in [HTG Brand Research](../research/branding/README.md) and [Issue #10](https://github.com/vitrixLab/hopkinstalentgroup/issues/10). Do not maintain duplicate copies here.

| ID | Website-specific dependency | Owner | Target date | Until resolved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W-01 | Current website route/content/asset inventory | TBD | TBD | Discovery incomplete |
| W-02 | Verified framework, hosting, deployment, domain, and DNS facts | TBD | TBD | No platform-specific assumptions |
| W-03 | Form purpose, required fields, recipient, privacy notice, and inquiry owner per route | TBD | TBD | Do not activate unowned CTA/form |
| W-04 | Approved content model/CMS or source-of-truth decision | TBD | TBD | Use controlled placeholders |
| W-05 | Analytics, cookies, integrations, and consent requirements | TBD | TBD | Do not add tracking/integrations |
| W-06 | Backup, rollback, monitoring, and release operator | TBD | TBD | Release blocked |

Owners and dates remain TBD until assigned by the authorized project decision-maker. Silence is not approval.

## 11. Risks and controls

| Risk | Control |
|---|---|
| Website repeats or contradicts strategy | Keep strategic definitions in the brand research source; link rather than duplicate |
| Website implies unverified ownership or service delivery | Use approved relationship and delivery classifications |
| Visitors cannot identify a useful next step | Map each page to a visitor task and verified CTA |
| Inquiry has no accountable recipient | Confirm recipient and operational owner before activation |
| Visual polish hides navigation/content problems | Test page tasks and comprehension before decorative refinement |
| Legal or privacy obligations are missed | Reserve content slots and obtain qualified review |
| Repeated cosmetic revisions produce no progress | Require a defect statement, measurable change, rendered comparison, and evidence |

## 12. Change control

- Issue #10 is the governing decision and approval thread.
- Related commit messages must reference (#10) using the repository convention.
- Record material scope, architecture, content, and release decisions in Issue #10.
- Update this README only for website-specific changes; update brand research only for strategic changes.
- Link PRs and commits to affected routes, tests, evidence, and unresolved risks.
- Never silently change approved facts or decisions.
